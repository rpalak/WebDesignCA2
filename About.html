               <img src="img/Mellisa.jpg" />
                <p>Melissa grew up in Hawkes Bay and studied at National College Of Ireland in Dublin-1 before embarking on a career in Human Resources.
                 After moving to London she specialised in Graduate Recruitment for the Investment Banking industry for 5 years. After returning 
                to Ireland and spending time with her parents (who now live just outside of Arrowtown), Melissa decided that the Queenstown area 
                was just too beautiful to live anywhere else.<br /><p>
                <p>For years Melissa has delighted friends, family and colleges with home made treats and now is making it into more than just a 
                hobby. Melissa started baking with her mother when she was young and has come along way from the bright pink marshmallow slice
                 they use to make every Sunday (although she still loves things that are pink and sweet, so some things never change). More 
                recently Melissa has studied cake decoration through Planet Cake, one of Ireland’s leading cake designers.
