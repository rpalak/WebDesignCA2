                    <h2>CUPCAKES PARTIES</h2>

                    <p>
                        We also offer cupcake parties for children’s birthdays (although we can do cupcake parties for all ages!).
                        These range from a basic party where children are able to decorate their cupcakes and takeaway boxes,
                        to parties where we are able to demonstrate how to make cupcakes from scratch. If you have a specific
                        cupcake design or themed party we can work with that too - for example if you have a ladybird themed party,
                        we could make lady bird cupcakes!
