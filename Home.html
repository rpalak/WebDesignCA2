                    <h2>CUPCAKES PARTIES</h2>

                    <p>
                        We also offer cupcake parties for children’s birthdays (although we can do cupcake parties for all ages!).
                        These range from a basic party where children are able to decorate their cupcakes and takeaway boxes,
                        to parties where we are able to demonstrate how to make cupcakes from scratch. If you have a specific
                        cupcake design or themed party we can work with that too - for example if you have a ladybird themed party,
                        we could make lady bird cupcakes!

            cake. Minimum order of 12 cupcakes. Alternatively, during summer these can be purchased individually
            at the Queenstown Farmers Market on Church Street on a Saturday morning between 9am - 12pm from December to March
